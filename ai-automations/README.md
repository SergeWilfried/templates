# AI Automations

A Next.js application that triggers automations via API calls, such as cancelling a subscription or processing a refund.

Note: this example currently uses a yet unreleased version of the Markprompt SDK, copied verbatim in the `lib/core` folder. This will soon be removed and work with a single import statement from `@markprompt/core`.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
